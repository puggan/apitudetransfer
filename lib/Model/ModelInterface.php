/**
 * Transfer Booking API
 *
 * # APItude Transfer Booking API  APItude also includes now the ability to book transfers. This API will provide you with availability for transfer services and allow you to distribute those not only through the websites but also is thought to support mobile and tablets.  APItude for transfers API is designed to provide Hotelbeds Group clients with a set of API calls to:   * Enable the construction or creation of a complete transfer website or mobile application (app) * Integrate transfer services into existing systems both internal and external. * Integrate transfers contents for transfers into a common CMS for all the products being distributed.  **Transfer Booking API** provides all the needed calls (operations) to develop your booking funnel, confirm a booking and obtain the relevant information for a customer to enjoy the transfer service that he or she bought.  To obtain and cache the static content you can use [Transfers Cache API](), an API designed to return all the static information needed to operate the Transfers BookingAPI as quickly and simple as possible.
